With Instant WordPress Dev, you can:

* Experiment with WordPress and decide if it is the right choice for a project, even if you are unfamiliar with how to setup web servers, database, and WordPress itself.
* Quickly create disposable sandbox WordPress instances, to try out new ideas in a fresh environment.
* Develop WordPress Themes and Plugins.
* Run a WordPress-related presentation or a presentation built in WordPress, without having to rely on an Internet connection.

== Features

* Create and destroy WordPress instances on the fly.
* Development WordPress instances automatically have users created for each standard WordPress role: admin, editor, author, contributor, subscriber.
* Passwordless login for those users, so you can easily test theme/plugin features that depend on them.
* Browse/hack your WordPress databases using http://www.adminer.org/[Adminer] (included).
* Mail sent by WordPress is collected in a screen on the control panel.

== Requirements

* PHP command line interpreter (which comes with its own light development web server)
* PHP MySQL PDO library
* PHP GD library (for manipulating images)
* MySQL Server (or MariaDB or Drizzle)

*Not* required:

* Any web server other than what comes with PHP
* A WordPress installer; this is downloaded automatically when you first run Instant WordPress Dev
* A mail server
